It took place at TRITUX Group headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia for a duration of four months starting from February untill June.
        \subsection{Learning Outcomes}  
          During my internship I had the opportunity of undergoing multiple trainings in which I have built a solid set of skills that were necessary for the development of the project. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to engage with IT experts. Then i started the development phase of the solution, putting my theoritical knowledge, gained during my studies at TBS, into practice. To conclude, this internship's aim was to help me as a graduating student gain professional experience in the Business-IT field.           
        
      \section{Project Overview}
       \subsection{Problem Statement}
         Efficient resource management constitutes a significant challenges for companies in the IT sector, and TRITUX is no exeption. The company's current use of limited systems and manual processes in tracking projects may result in high operational costs and reduced client satisfaction.
         \\The lack of a unified system that predicts project requirements makes the management and desicion-making processes difficult and imprecise, leading to major problems such as project overruns, misuse of skilled resources and inability to meet client expectations.
         \\This challenges calls for the need for a solution that analyzes the historical projects to help forcast future projects requirements and ensure the optimization of resource allocation. This solution needs to include data integration, descriptive, predective and prescriptive analysis 
         \\This project ensures that the resources are well allocated. This will result in improving project efficiency, client satisfaction and the company's profitability. This system will also include a user-friendly dashboard showing real time data to help make informed decisions.

      \subsection{Existing Solutions Study}
        Before starting, a study for the existing solutions needs to be conducted to analyze better the limitations of the currently used systems.
        \subsubsection{Solution Implemented By The Company}
          TRITUX Group is one of the main providers of IT solutions. Given the complexity of this projects, a system for project management and tracking is a must.\\
          The solution currently used by the company is Jira Software. Jira is a software for project management developped by Atlassian in 2002. It allows both developpers and non-developpers to manage projects and track any bugs or incidents related. It uses the agile method.\\

            \includegraphics[width=10cm]{Logos/jira.png}
            \caption{Jira Software}        
          \end{figure}
        \subsubsection{Limitations of the Existing Solution}
          Despite being a widely-used tool for project management, Jira software lacks many important features:
          \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Limited Resource Management Featurtes: }While Jira Software offers some resource management tools, it lacks detailed insights into resources availability, resources allocation efficiency and skillset matching.   
            \item \textbf{Lack of Predective Analytics: }Jira offers some reporting and analytics features, but it lacks in-depth forcasting capabilities of the resource requirements    
            \item \textbf{User Interface Complexity: }Jira's user interface can be difficult to understand for new users, leading to harder learning and potential resistance from users.
            \item \textbf{Cost and Scalability Concerns: }Jira costs can increase significantly as projects scale due to the need for extra advanced features.
            \item \textbf{Inflexibility in Custom Reporting: }Reporting in Jira may be complex especially those related to resource allocation.
          \end{itemize}

      \section{Methodology}
        Project management methodologies guide us through all of the project lifecycle. It starts with planning, initiating and implementing the work. These models are used to plan the work tasks to help us meet our objectives. A variety of project management tools are available but i chose to work with the the Scrum methodology.\\
        Scrum methodology suggests that we must fix short-term objectives and split the project into iterations called "sprints", two to four weeks each. A sprint starts with a meeting in which the team chooses the elements to work on from the backlog. Daily meetings are held during sprints to discuss progress and challenges. At the end of a sprint, a meeting is held to review and receive feedbacks about the progress done in the sprint.\\
        Scrum methodology helped me respond to the changing needs of this project and provide a well-structured approach to manage it.

        \section{Conclusion}
          To sum up, I started with introducing the host company and descriping the internship. Then I moved to a project overview where I made a study about the solution currently implemented by the company to show its weeknesses and limitations. Finally I introduced and explained the methodology I will implement in this project.
